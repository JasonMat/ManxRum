JAGS is designed to work closely with the R language and environment for statistical computation and graphics (http://www.r-project.org). You will find it useful to install the coda package for R to analyze the output.

	abstract = {Declines in large vertebrate populations are widespread but difficult to detect from monitoring data and hard to understand due to a multiplicity of plausible biological explanations. In parts of Scotland, harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) have been in decline for 10 years. To evaluate the contributions of different proximate causes (survival, fecundity, observation artefacts) to this decline, we collated behavioural, demographic and population data from one intensively studied population in part of the Moray Firth (north-east Scotland). To these, we fit a state-space model comprising age-structured dynamics and a detailed account of observation errors. After accounting for culling (estimated by our model as 14 \% of total mortality), the main driver of the historical population decline was a decreasing trend in survival of young individuals combined with (previously unrecognised) low levels of pupping success. In more recent years, the model provides evidence for considerable increases in breeding success and consistently high levels of adult survival. However, breeding success remains the most volatile demographic component of the population. Forecasts from the model indicate a slow population recovery, providing cautious support for recent management measures. Such investigations of the proximate causes of population change (survival, fecundity and observation errors) provide valuable short-term support for the management of population declines, helping to focus future data collection on those ultimate causal mechanisms that are not excluded by the demographic evidence. The contribution of specific ultimate drivers (e.g. shooting mortality or competitors) can also be quantified by including them as covariates to survival or fecundity. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

A PRESS perturbation is a sustained alteration of species densities (often a complete elimination of particular species); it is maintained until the unperturbed species reach a new equilibrium. PULSE experiments yield information only on direct interactions while PRESS experiments yield information on direct interactions mixed together with the indirect effects mediated through other species in the community.

	abstract = {Assessing the impacts of ongoing climate and anthropogenic-induced change on wildlife populations requires understanding species distributions and abundances across large spatial and temporal scales. For threatened or declining populations, collecting sufficient broad-scale data is challenging as sample sizes tend to be low because many such species are rare and/or elusive. As a result, demographic data are often piecemeal, leading to difficulties in determining causes of population changes and developing strategies to mitigate the effects of environmental stressors. Thus, the population dynamics of threatened species across spatio-temporal extents is typically inferred through incomplete, independent, local-scale studies. Emerging integrative modeling approaches, such as integrated population models (IPMs), combine multiple data types into a single analysis and provide a foundation for overcoming problems of sparse or fragmentary data. In this paper, we demonstrate how IPMs can be successfully implemented by synthesizing the elements, advantages, and novel insights of this modeling approach. We highlight the latest developments in IPMs that are explicitly relevant to the ecology and conservation of threatened species, including capabilities to quantify the spatial scale of management, source-sink dynamics, synchrony within metapopulations, and population density effects on demographic rates. Adoption of IPMs has led to improved detection of population declines, adaptation of targeted monitoring schemes, and refined management strategies. Continued methodological advancements of IPMs, such as incorporation of a wider set of data types (e.g., citizen science data) and coupled population-environment models, will allow for broader applicability within ecological and conservation sciences.},

	abstract = {1. The balance between economic growth and wildlife conservation is a priority for many governments. Enhancing realism in assessment of population-level impacts of anthropogenic mortality can help achieve this balance. Population Viability Analysis (PVA) is commonly applied to investigate population vulnerability, but outcomes of PVA are sensitive to formulations of density-dependence, environ- mental stochasticity and life history. Current practice in marine assessments is to use precautionary models that assume no compensation from density-depend- ence or rescue-effects via “re-seeding” from other colonies. However, if we could empirically quantify regulatory population processes, the responses of popula- tions to additional anthropogenic mortality may be assessed with more realism in PVA. 2. Using Bayesian state-space models fitted to population time series from three sympatric seabird populations, selected for varied life histories, we inferred the extent to which their dynamics are driven by environmental stochasticity and density-dependence. 3. Based on these inferences, we conducted an exhaustive PVA across credible pa- rameterizations for intrinsic and extrinsic population regulation, simulated as a closed and re-seeded system. Scenarios of anthropogenic mortality, along a slid- ing scale of precaution, were applied both proportionally and as a fixed quota using Potential Biological Removal (PBR). 4. Baseline results from fitting revealed clear environmental regulation in two of our three species. Crucially, we found that for our empirically derived, realistic model parameterizations there are risks of decline to real populations even under very precautionary mortality scenarios. We find that PBR is dubious in application as a sustainable tool for population assessment when we account for regulation. Closed versus re-seeded models showed a large divergence in outcomes, with sharper declines in closed simulations. Fixed-quota mortality typically induced greater population declines comparative to proportional mortality, subject to reg- ulation and re-seeding.},

              Rodent predators are implicated in declines of seabird populations, and removing introduced rats, often, but not always, results in the expected conservation gains. Here we investigated the relationship between small mammal (Norway rat, wood mouse and pygmy shrew) abundance and Manx shearwater breeding success on the island of Rum, Scotland, and tested whether localised rodenticide treatments (to control introduced Norway rats) increased Manx shearwater breeding success. We found that Manx shearwater breeding success was negatively correlated with late summer indices of abundance for rats and mice, but not shrews. On its own, rat activity was a poor predictor of Manx shearwater breeding success. Rat activity increased during the shearwater breeding season in untreated areas but was supressed in areas treated with rodenticides. Levels of mouse (and shrew) activity increased in areas treated with rodenticides (likely in response to lower levels of rat activity) and Manx shearwater breeding success was unchanged in treated areas (
              p
               {\textless} 0.1). The results suggest that, unexpectedly, negative effects from wood mice can substitute those of Norway rats and that both species contributed to negative impacts on Manx shearwaters. Impacts were intermittent however, and further research is needed to characterise rodent population trends and assess the long-term risks to this seabird colony. The results have implications for conservation practitioners planning rat control programmes on islands where multiple rodent species are present.},

Possibly as much as one third of the world population nests on the island of Rum off the west coast of Scotland but the population is thought to be in decline and possibly under threat from mammalian predators. Birds have been ringed at the colony for eighteen years so there is a large potential dataset available to allow a mark-recapture study. This data set was analysed for trends in survival and rate of population growth using maximum likelihood statistical methods in program MARK. Parameter estimates derived from these maximum likelihood models suggest that survival is consistently very high and that the population has expanded over the course of the study period. These trends were further investigated for correlation with several environmental covariates. Index values were used for North Atlantic Oscillation, surface sea temperature, mean monthly rainfall, fishing productivity, and the number of days of winter frost over the course of the study period. Correlations were found between surface sea temperature and mean monthly rainfall, and the rate of population growth. The other covariates were not significant and none were found to be useful in explaining changes in apparent survival over time. These results were analysed in the light of studies on other seabirds and Shearwater species and explanations sought for some of the trends. Ongoing productivity monitoring of the Rum population should be continued and further research into the foraging dynamics and feeding ecology of the species undertaken.},

Seabirds represent one of the most threatened groups of birds in the world, and climate change and severe weather is a prominent and increasing threat to this group. We used a multi-state capture-recapture model to examine how the demographic rates of a long-lived trans-oceanic migrant seabird, the Manx shearwater
              Puffinus puffinus
              , are influenced by environmental conditions experienced at different stages of the annual breeding cycle and whether these relationships vary with an individual’s breeding state in the previous year (i.e., successful breeder, failed breeder and non-breeder). Our results imply that populations of Manx shearwaters are comprised of individuals with different demographic profiles, whereby more successful reproduction is associated with higher rates of survival and breeding propensity. However, we found that all birds experienced the same negative relationship between rates of survival and wind force during the breeding season, indicating a cost of reproduction (or central place constraint for non-breeders) during years with severe weather conditions. We also found that environmental effects differentially influence the breeding propensity of individuals in different breeding states. This suggests individual spatio-temporal variation in habitat use during the annual cycle, such that climate change could alter the frequency that individuals with different demographic profiles breed thereby driving a complex and less predictable population response. More broadly, our study highlights the importance of considering individual-level factors when examining population demography and predicting how species may respond to climate change.},

	title = {Rum {Rats}: {Ecology} and {Behaviour}},
	abstract = {The Isle of Rum hosts approximately 25\% of the global population of Manx shearwaters, Puffinus puffinus. Potential for negative impacts on the shearwater colonies from introduced Norway rats, Rattus norvegicus, has highlighted the need to better understand the ecology of this island invader. Abundance and population estimates are often central to effective conservation and invasive species management. Despite their potentially catastrophic impacts on seabird populations, the ecology of Norway rats on islands is poorly understood. Developing an appropriate tool to measure rat population size is therefore important. Furthermore, an understanding of the movement patterns and diet of introduced Norway rats is vital to establishing the nature of their relationship with native species. Optimisation (transect duration/length) of two common rodent activity survey techniques (tracking plates and chocolate-flavoured wax blocks) was carried out to derive parameters that resulted in a standard deviation of the bootstrapped distribution of the mean (precision) of less than 0.2. Activity survey scores were then calibrated against capturemark-recapture population estimates for linear (coast, river, wall) and non-linear (grassland, heath, woodland) sites. An island-wide population estimate of Norway rats on Rum was calculated using extrapolated density estimates for linear features (boundary strip method) and non-linear vegetation types (SECR models). Home range size of 17 Norway rats, across three study sites (coast, heath, river) was estimated. Jacob’s Index was used to compare vegetation availability (home range) with use (location points), and Spearman’s correlation for a relationship between capture rates (C100TN) and distance to linear features. Stomach content analysis was used to describe the diet of 29 rats across three ecotopes (coast, grassland, urban) on Rum. Activity indices reached an acceptable level of precision after three days and a grid size of 35 x 10m2 from tracking plate (linear and non-linear sites) and wax block (non-linear sites only) surveys. Total population size of Norway rats on Rum was estimated at 11,844 ± 5,685 for non-linear/linear sites combined. Mean home range size (MCP100) was estimated at 2.32 ± 0.86 hectares, with differences between sex and site found. Distance to coast had a strong negative correlation with mean capture rates. Vegetation and invertebrates were the most frequent/abundant food types across all ecotopes. Calibrated tracking plates are preferable for the use of estimating population size of Norway rats on islands. Coastal environments are likely to be an important resource for introduced rats; woodland may offer intra-island refugia to rats on Rum. Overall, Norway rats are unlikely to be a current threat to Manx shearwaters on Rum.},

	abstract = {Background: Wildlife populations are difficult to monitor directly because of costs and logistical challenges associated with collecting informative abundance data from live animals. By contrast, data on harvested individuals (e.g., age and sex) are often readily available. Increasingly, integrated population models are used for natural resource management because they synthesize various relevant data into a single analysis.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the performance of integrated population models applied to black bears (Ursus americanus) in Minnesota, USA. Models were constructed using sex-specific age-at-harvest matrices (1980–2008), data on hunting effort and natural food supplies (which affects hunting success), and statewide mark–recapture estimates of abundance (1991, 1997, 2002). We compared this approach to Downing reconstruction, a commonly used population monitoring method that utilizes only age-at-harvest data. We first conducted a large-scale simulation study, in which our integrated models provided more accurate estimates of population trends than did Downing reconstruction. Estimates of trends were robust to various forms of model misspecification, including incorrectly specified cub and yearling survival parameters, age-related reporting biases in harvest data, and unmodeled temporal variability in survival and harvest rates. When applied to actual data on Minnesota black bears, the model predicted that harvest rates were negatively correlated with food availability and positively correlated with hunting effort, consistent with independent telemetry data. With no direct data on fertility, the model also correctly predicted 2-point cycles in cub production. Model-derived estimates of abundance for the most recent years provided a reasonable match to an empirical population estimate obtained after modeling efforts were completed.
Conclusions/Significance: Integrated population modeling provided a reasonable framework for synthesizing age-atharvest data, periodic large-scale abundance estimates, and measured covariates thought to affect harvest rates of black bears in Minnesota. Collection and analysis of these data appear to form the basis of a robust and viable population monitoring program.},

Seabirds such as shearwaters and petrels can be especially affected, perhaps because of their propensity to fly close to the surface, making them vulnerable to encountering anthropogenic light sources. We investigated the influence of light pollution on adult Manx Shearwaters Puffinus puffinus at close range in foggy conditions. We recorded collisions with a building at a breeding colony for six consecutive pairs of intervals in which the house lights were left on as normal for 135 seconds, then turned off for 135 seconds. The relationship between lighting condition and collision frequency was highly significant, with a collision rate in the presence of lighting around 25 times that in its absence. Our results show that birds were clearly affected by the lights, by being either directly attracted, or disorientated during flight close to the structure. This could have been due to the light source itself, or an indirect effect of the all-round reflective glow in the fog perhaps interfering with visual or magnetic control inputs on both sides of the bird simultaneously. Our results suggest a mechanism by which the screening of artificial lights close to shearwater breeding areas, at least during foggy nights, could lead to improved welfare and survival at breeding colonies.},
